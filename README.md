A music sharing app where you can share your favourite songs for your friends!

Have a look and post at [music-app](https://music-list-fac.herokuapp.com/)


## User stories
### Core

- [ ] As a user, I want to: post a song that I like for anyone to see
- [ ] As a user, I want to: see other people's favourite songs they posted about

Stretch goal: 
- [ ] As a user, I want to filter by user so I can see a collection of one person's favourite songs
- [ ] As a curious user, I want to sort all posted songs by rating


## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] A form for users to submit data
- [ ] A page showing all the data
- [ ] Semantic form elements with correctly associated labels
- [ ] A SQLite database
- [ ] A schema describing your database in your README
- [ ] Tests for server routes and database access
- [ ] Not process user input as SQL commands
- [ ] Hidden environment variables (i.e. not on GitHub)

## Stretch criteria

- [ ] A way to view filtered/sorted data, instead of just all of it
    GitHub Actions CI setup to run your tests when you push
